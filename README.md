# Analyzing the Green Energy Stock Market

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose
Steveâ€™s parents are looking to invest in green energy so we helped Steve create a Visual Basic for Applications code that analyzed a dozen of green energy stocks. Taking it another step, we refactored the original code to allow it to run more quickly and smoothly. In addition to quicker run time, refactoring the code allowed it to run for the entire stock market which included thousands of different data points. Steve and his parents can now look through the entire stock market for green energy with visual indicators and better readability.
